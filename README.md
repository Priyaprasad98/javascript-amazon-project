# 🛒 Amazon-Style Checkout and Order Tracking System

A frontend project simulating an Amazon-style checkout and basic order management system using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. This project is part of my learning journey focused on understanding shopping cart systems, dynamic pricing, simple order tracking, and real-time UI updates using core web technologies.
